# Paraglide - Paragraph Processor

A program designed to automate the process of **sequentially copying each paragraph** from a loaded .TXT file and moving to the **next paragraph upon detecting Ctrl[Cmd] + V input**.

## Key Features

1. Load .TXT files and split paragraphs, displaying **previous/current/next** paragraphs.
2. Monitor keyboard input and perform **actions based on key combinations**:
   - **Paste (Ctrl + V, Cmd + V)**: Copy the next paragraph.
   - **Alt (Opt) + Arrow Keys (←→)**: Navigate to the previous/next paragraph.
   - **Alt (Opt) + Arrow Keys (↑↓)**: Pause/Resume the program.
3. Display the **current paragraph in progress** with an overlay window and allow navigation between paragraphs.
4. Save logs to restore the **last position** when reloading a previously processed file.

## Purpose of Development

Inspired by [SB2Tool](https://github.com/JOWONRO/SB2Tool), this program addresses one major limitation of the original tool: **it was Windows-exclusive**. 

Despite not being a professional coder, I enthusiastically leveraged GPT to create this program. Written in **JavaScript** (NPM, React, Electron), it works across platforms, making it **more versatile** than the Windows-only predecessor.

Although the beta version is still under development, the current pace suggests that a release might be possible within this month.

## Contribution

***Your contributions can enhance the quality of this program!***  
We deeply appreciate feedback and assistance from talented individuals.  
Feel free to suggest improvements or highlight areas that need refinement!

## Running the Program

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WareAoba/Paraglide
   ```

2. Install NPM in root directory of the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WareAoba/Paraglide
   ```

3. Run the program with the following command:
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Precompiled binaries will be uploaded at a later date.


 ## Recent Updates

 1. **Sidebar** Added: View recent files and switch to them directly.
 2. Task Completion Button: A fun but admittedly trivial addition.
 3. **Keyboard Shortcuts Activated**: Shortcuts are now fully functional!
 4. Clipboard Monitoring: The program automatically pauses when external clipboard changes are detected.

## Features in Development

 1. Browsing Feature: Scroll through all paragraphs (to be implemented with a button and new window).
 2. Search Function: Search text/paragraphs and jump to the desired paragraph.
 3. Click-to-Jump in the overlay window.
 4. Enhanced Animations: The most challenging part—requires significant rework.
 5. UI Icons: From pause/resume buttons to future buttons.
 6. Settings: Modify font size/type, overlay visibility defaults, highlight colors, etc.
 7. User Guide: A detailed manual to accompany the beta release.
 8. File Editing: Simple modifications like renaming files or editing paragraph content.

## Known Issues

 1. Overlay layout misalignment: Paragraphs should have equal spacing, but gaps between current/next and previous/current are inconsistent.
 2. UI properties are being migrated to CSS, leaving the UI temporarily messy.
 3. The new Sidebar’s design is subpar—scheduled for improvement.
 4. Issues with real-time theme switching; handlers seem to be missing.
 5. Files load in a paused state—reason unknown.
 6. Logging functionality is broken again 😭.
 7. The ribbon menu is visible in the Windows build and needs to be removed.
 8. Files occasionally unload randomly, with the cause still unidentified.

## Beta Release?
The ongoing CSS theme implementation is a daunting task and may take a few more days, but essential features should be completed soon. Beta v0.1 is targeted for release by the end of the month.
If I had coding experience, this would’ve progressed much faster, but tinkering with AI often breaks working features—fixing those takes up most of my time. 😂
